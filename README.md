# AWX on Single Node K3s

An example implementation of AWX on single node K3s using AWX Operator, with easy-to-use simplified configuration with ownership of data and passwords.

- Accessible over HTTPS from remote host
- All data will be stored under `/data`
- Fixed (configurable) passwords for AWX and PostgreSQL
- Fixed (configurable) versions of AWX

**If you want to view the guide for the specific version of AWX Operator, switch the page to the desired tag instead of the `main` branch.**

## Environment

- Tested on:
  - CentOS Stream 8 (Minimal)
  - K3s v1.28.4+k3s2
- Products that will be deployed:
  - AWX Operator 2.9.0
  - AWX 23.5.1
  - PostgreSQL 13

## References

- [INSTALL.md on ansible/awx](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/23.5.1/INSTALL.md) @23.5.1
- [README.md on ansible/awx-operator](https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator/blob/2.9.0/README.md) @2.9.0

## Requirements

- **Computing resources**
  - **2 CPUs and 4 GiB RAM minimum**.
  - It's recommended to add more CPUs and RAM (like 4 CPUs and 8 GiB RAM or more) to avoid performance issue and job scheduling issue.
  - The files in this repository are configured to ignore resource requirements which specified by AWX Operator by default.
- **Storage resources**
  - At least **10 GiB for `/var/lib/rancher`** and **10 GiB for `/data`** are safe for fresh install.
  - **Both will be grown during lifetime** and **actual consumption highly depends on your environment and your use case**, so you should to pay attention to the consumption and add more capacity if required.
  - `/var/lib/rancher` will be created and consumed by K3s and related data like container images and overlayfs.
  - `/data` will be created in this guide and used to store AWX-related databases and files.

## Deployment Instruction

### Prepare CentOS Stream 8 host

Disable firewalld and nm-cloud-setup if enabled. This is [recommended by K3s](https://docs.k3s.io/advanced#red-hat-enterprise-linux--centos).

```bash
# Disable firewalld
sudo systemctl disable firewalld --now

# Disable nm-cloud-setup if exists and enabled
sudo systemctl disable nm-cloud-setup.service nm-cloud-setup.timer
sudo reboot
```

Install required packages to deploy AWX Operator and AWX.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y git curl
```

### Install K3s

Install specific version of K3s with `--write-kubeconfig-mode 644` to make config file (`/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`) readable by non-root user.

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=v1.28.4+k3s2 sh -s - --write-kubeconfig-mode 644
```

### Install AWX Operator

Clone this repository and change directory.

If you want to use files suitable for the specific version of AWX Operator, [refer tags in this repository](https://github.com/kurokobo/awx-on-k3s/tags) and specify desired tag in `git checkout`. Especially for `0.13.0` or earlier version of AWX Operator, refer to [üìùTips: Deploy older version of AWX Operator](tips/deploy-older-operator.md).

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/kurokobo/awx-on-k3s.git
cd awx-on-k3s
git checkout 2.9.0
```

Then invoke `kubectl apply -k operator` to deploy AWX Operator.

```bash
kubectl apply -k operator
```

The AWX Operator will be deployed to the namespace `awx`.

```bash
$ kubectl -n awx get all
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/awx-operator-controller-manager-68d787cfbd-kjfg7   2/2     Running   0          16s

NAME                                                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/awx-operator-controller-manager-metrics-service   ClusterIP   10.43.150.245   <none>        8443/TCP   16s

NAME                                              READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/awx-operator-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           16s

NAME                                                         DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/awx-operator-controller-manager-68d787cfbd   1         1         1       16s
```

### Prepare required files to deploy AWX

Generate a Self-Signed certificate. Note that IP address can't be specified. If you want to use a certificate from public ACME CA such as Let's Encrypt or ZeroSSL instead of Self-Signed certificate, follow the guide on [üìÅ **Use SSL Certificate from Public ACME CA**](acme) first and come back to this step when done.

```bash
AWX_HOST="awx.example.com"
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -out ./base/tls.crt -keyout ./base/tls.key -subj "/CN=${AWX_HOST}/O=${AWX_HOST}" -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:${AWX_HOST}"
```

Modify `hostname` in `base/awx.yaml`.

```yaml
...
spec:
  ...
  ingress_type: ingress
  ingress_tls_secret: awx-secret-tls
  hostname: awx.example.com     üëàüëàüëà
...
```

Modify two `password`s in `base/kustomization.yaml`. Note that the `password` under `awx-postgres-configuration` should not contain single or double quotes (`'`, `"`) or backslashes (`\`) to avoid any issues during deployment, backup or restoration.

```yaml
...
  - name: awx-postgres-configuration
    type: Opaque
    literals:
      - host=awx-postgres-13
      - port=5432
      - database=awx
      - username=awx
      - password=Ansible123!     üëàüëàüëà
      - type=managed

  - name: awx-admin-password
    type: Opaque
    literals:
      - password=Ansible123!     üëàüëàüëà
...
```

Prepare directories for Persistent Volumes defined in `base/pv.yaml`. These directories will be used to store your databases and project files. Note that the size of the PVs and PVCs are specified in some of the files in this repository, but since their backends are `hostPath`, its value is just like a label and there is no actual capacity limitation.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /data/postgres-13
sudo mkdir -p /data/projects
sudo chmod 755 /data/postgres-13
sudo chown 1000:0 /data/projects
```

### Deploy AWX

Deploy AWX, this takes few minutes to complete.

```bash
kubectl apply -k base
```

To monitor the progress of the deployment, check the logs of `deployments/awx-operator-controller-manager`:

```bash
kubectl -n awx logs -f deployments/awx-operator-controller-manager
```

When the deployment completes successfully, the logs end with:

```txt
$ kubectl -n awx logs -f deployments/awx-operator-controller-manager
...
----- Ansible Task Status Event StdOut (awx.ansible.com/v1beta1, Kind=AWX, awx/awx) -----

localhost                  : ok=84   changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=79   rescued=0    ignored=1
```

Required objects has been deployed next to AWX Operator in `awx` namespace.

```bash
$ kubectl -n awx get awx,all,ingress,secrets

```

Now your AWX is available at `https://awx.example.com/` or the hostname you specified.

Note that you have to access via hostname that you specified in `base/awx.yaml`, instead of IP address, since this guide uses Ingress. So you should configure your DNS or `hosts` file on your client where the browser is running.

At this point, AWX can be accessed via HTTP as well as HTTPS. If you want to force users to use HTTPS, see [üìùTips: Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](tips/enable-hsts.md).

## Back up and Restore AWX using AWX Operator

The AWX Operator `0.10.0` or later has the ability to back up and restore AWX in easy way.

Refer [üìÅ **Back up AWX using AWX Operator**](backup) and [üìÅ **Restore AWX using AWX Operator**](restore) for details.
