## Concepts

In order to use a valid SSL certificate issued by public ACME CA for Ingress, you we to run some kind of ACME client software.

Traefik, the default Ingress controller for K3s, has a built-in ACME client, but it is a bit complicated to make it work, so in this guide, we will use [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/).

To issue a certificate from the ACME CA using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/), we must first create [an Issuer or ClusterIssuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/) resource that contains the account information to be registered with the ACME CA and the information to be used for the HTTP-01 and DNS-01 challenges.

Once the Issuer has been created, simply specify the Issuer in the annotation of the Ingress resource, and cert-manager will do all the necessary work automatically.

Fortunately, AWX Operator has a parameter to add arbitrary annotations to Ingress, so protecting our AWX instance with a certificate from a public ACME CA is a breeze.

In this example, we will use:

- [**DNS-01** challenge](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/)
- with [**Azure DNS**](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/azuredns/)
- with [**Service Principal**](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/azuredns/#service-principal)

This guide does not provide any information how to configure Azure, other DNS services, or how to use HTTP-01 challenge here. Please refer to the document of cert-manager for details.

## Procedure

### Deploy cert-manager

Deploy cert-manager first.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.3/cert-manager.yaml
```

Ensure the pods in `cert-manager` namespace are running.

```bash
$ kubectl -n cert-manager get pod
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-55658cdf68-rfqmf             1/1     Running   0          21h
cert-manager-cainjector-967788869-xnq2n   1/1     Running   0          21h
cert-manager-webhook-6668fbb57d-r9dmj     1/1     Running   0          21h
```

### Prepare Issuer

To use **DNS-01** challenge with **Azure DNS** with **Service Principal**, the following information is required.

- **Client ID**
  - [Azure Active Directory] > [App registrations] > Your Application > [Application ID]
- **Client Secret**
  - [Azure Active Directory] > [App registrations] > Your Application > [Certificates & secrets] > [Client secrets] > [Value]
- **Subscription ID**
  - [DNS zones] > Your Zone > [Subscription ID]
- **Tenant ID**
  - [Azure Active Directory] > [Properties] > [Tenant ID]
- **Name of Resource Group**
  - [DNS zones] > Your Zone > [Resource group]
- **Name of DNS Zone**
  - [DNS zones] > Your Zone

Then modify required fields in `acme/issuer.yaml`.

```yaml
...
spec:
  acme:
    email: cert@example.com     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ

    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ

    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: awx-issuer-account-key

    solvers:
      - dns01:
          azureDNS:
            clientID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ
            subscriptionID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ
            tenantID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ
            resourceGroupName: example-rg     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ
            hostedZoneName: example.com     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ
            environment: AzurePublicCloud
            clientSecretSecretRef:
              name: azuredns-config
              key: client-secret
```

To store Client Secret for the Service Principal to Secret resource in Kubernetes, modify `acme/kustomization.yaml`.

```yaml
...
  - name: azuredns-config
    type: Opaque
    literals:
      - client-secret=0000000000000000000000000000000000     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ
...
```

Once the file has been modified to suit your environment, deploy the Issuer.

```bash
kubectl apply -k acme
```

Ensure your Issuer exists in `awx` namespace.

```bash
$ kubectl -n awx get issuer
NAME         READY   AGE
awx-issuer   True    21h
```

### Modify configuration files for AWX

Now that we have an Issuer, the last step is to add annotations to Ingress. A few files under the `base` directory need to be modified.

In `base/awx.yaml`, correct `hostname` to the FQDN which the certificate will be issued, and add `ingress_annotations` parameter to specify which Issuer will be used.

```yaml
spec:
  ...
  ingress_type: ingress
  ingress_tls_secret: awx-secret-tls
  hostname: awx.example.com     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ

  ingress_annotations: |     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ
    cert-manager.io/issuer: awx-issuer     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ
```

Finally, comment out or delete all of the `awx-secret-tls` part in `base/kustomization.yaml`, as the actual contents of `awx-secret-tls` are automatically managed by cert-manager and do not need to be specified manually.

```yaml
...
generatorOptions:
  disableNameSuffixHash: true

secretGenerator:
  # - name: awx-secret-tls     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ
  #   type: kubernetes.io/tls     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ
  #   files:     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ
  #     - tls.crt     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ
  #     - tls.key     ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ

  - name: awx-postgres-configuration
    type: Opaque
...
```

Now your configuration files to ready to use ACME CA. Go back [`README.md`](https://github.com/kurokobo/awx-on-k3s#prepare-required-files) and proceed the procedure.

Once the AWX instance is up and running, we can access it over HTTPS and we will see that our AWX protected by a valid SSL certificate.
